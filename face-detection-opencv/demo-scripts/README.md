# Here is a demo scripts helper

You need to set both `face-detection_0.1_<arch>.snap` and `face-detection_0.2_<arch>.snap` into that directory.

0.1 is the working version, 0.2 is broken on purpose (just build the package twice for your board and change 0.1 to 0.2 in snapcraft.yaml to trigger the broken behavior).
